## 2. [Open Source and Repo Setup](2_set_up_repo/readme.md) Reflection

* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person
* Describe what open source means
* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
* Assess the importance of using licenses
* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

To create a repository on GitHub, access your GitHub account. From your GitHub account, click the 'Repositories' tab or navigate to: https://github.com/new (after being logged in to your account). The form to create your repository should pop up in your browser window. Fill in the fields for your repository name under 'Repository Name' and add an optional description for your repository under 'Description'. To make your repository public to the GitHub community select 'Public'. To choose who can access your repository select 'Private'. Give your repository a README document for other developers looking at your repository by checking the 'Initialize this repository with a README' check-box. Set the type of licensing you want to place on your repository to allow certain permissions on how you want others to use and/or interact with your repository. 

When software is open source, it means that its programming code is shared and available for others to use, modify, and develop. This means that open source software is built and developed upon by a community of programmers (generally unbounded by any single institution, entity, or organization). I think the open source community allows for progressive software development and the perpetual development of innovative ideas from users who utilize and are most invested in the software. It doesn't really make me nervous. In fact, I find it reassuring and convenient to know that there exists a community of likeminded individuals who are passionate about coding. Still, I have doubts about anything being utopian and one worry I have is that the hard work of certain programmers won't or will not be properly creditted or compensated for.

Licensing seems to allow the developer the type of accreditation required by the original developer. With licensing, the developer is able to choose the certain permissions he/she would like to allow others for using the original developer's work. 

This challenge introduced me to creating repositories and further developed my understanding of the legal implications behind publishing. I never really understood the different types of licensing available and what those licenses entailed. I also have a better understanding about how the open source community operates.
