## 3. [Web Basics](3_web_basics/readme.md) Reflection

* What 2 new things did you learn about the web?
* What are some important things to remember when setting up your HTML site?
* How did you feel when you saw your web page live?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

Most of what I learned from this challenge was related to web domains. I learned what DNS stands for (Domain Name System) and its purpose. Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) was a new organization to me. I found it interesting that registrars like GoDaddy are required apply for a license to sell domain names from ICANN with a $2500 application fee and an annual payment of $4000 to maintain the validity of the license. Another interesting tidbit was learning that ICANN has begun to allow for any phrase to be a top-level domain like '.pepsi' or '.ipad' for a steep price.

Probably the most important thing to remember when setting up an HTML webpage is to open and close your data or information between '<html></html>' tags. Also, remembering to save your document in a '.html' file. When I saw my live web page, it was like the glory days of completing my first "Hello World" exercises in college. Although I do like the ease in setting everything up through GitHub.

GitHub and its features are making more sense to me as we are continuing to use it for our exercises. Hooray for GitHub!
