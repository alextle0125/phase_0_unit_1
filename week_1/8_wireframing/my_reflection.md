## 6. [Wireframing](6_wireframing/readme.md) Reflection

* * What did you learn about design and user experience? 
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)

* What questions did you ask during this challnge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?  
* What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?  
* Did you learn any new skills or tricks?
* How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies for this challenge? 
* Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?
* Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

These days, design feels so immersed in every thing we interact with. I think this an indirect result of Steve Jobs and the Apple culture which is why I found it a little astonishing to read that the most cumbersome part of designing for a product to be bureaucratic issues. Of course, these issues are unavoidable in any cooperative environment but you would think these issues would have been mitigated. I appreciate the mentality of design thinking - a visionary mode of thinking which is constructed in a method that parallels the scientific method. It was interesting to read about its implementation as a methodology beneficial to business structure and to group work. I also enjoyed reading about wireframing. Before our reading, I was ignorant about the fact that it was pretty much an industry practice. I knew a little bit about it, and I knew it was a practice that I used in my graphic projects but I didn't know how many people actually practiced it and that there are software out there specifically designed for wireframing.

I personally enjoy design and user experience aspect of coding. Presentation and aesthetics are elements that I think are essential to our contemporary short-attention-spanned society. I'd assume that people would be more likely to download an app that appears more visually appealing but is limited in functionality than one that is visually appalling but offers a variety of features (if at least only initially). A question I wonder is how much of our Dev Bootcamp experience will involve design concepts.

With this challenge, I learned that the Adobe Creative Suite can be a good tool for wireframing and probably the most important part of designing is the involved in the planning stages. I felt pretty confident with this challenge. I liked the reverse engineering or backward wireframing that we were asked complete for this challenge. I felt like it gave me a new look at some of the web pages that I often look at, but I found some of the reading to be a little bit disoriented (especially the wikipedia article).
