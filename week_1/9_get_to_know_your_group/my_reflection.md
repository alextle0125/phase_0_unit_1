Hey all, 

I'm Alex. I'm looking forward to getting phase 0 rolling with you all. I am currently living in Southern California so I think we'll have to pair up digitally. Anyway, my favorite websites for reading are: The Huffington Post, Ars Technica (yup, me too Alexei), and the International Business Times. I'm a Concrete Random thinker which is supposedly the experimenter or experimenting-type of thinking style. I also got multimodal on the VARK learning style assessment with a near even split between reading/writing and kinesthetic learning styles. I guess both results mean that I learn and work better when I am interacting and involved in the work or the lab environment. 

I'll post my availability for the next week below so if you find a time that works for you just send me an an email.

Take a moment to reflect on reading other people's responses regarding their fears about DBC. How did that make you feel? Did you feel better, worse, or something else all together? How has your experience this week influenced your feelings? All feelings are welcome and ok. Just take a moment to think about it and write it down. 

After reading the cultural blogs of my accountability group, I feel a little more at ease with the nervousness I've been feeling about this life-changing opportunity with DBC. We're all a little nervous and very excited. I don't think any of us have been a part of such an unconventional learning environment, but it seems like we're all confident in this style of instruction. The DBC culture is rich. I feel better knowing that I will be around others who are taking a leap into the uncomfortable (especially those who; like me, are moving across the country to be a part of this). After the first week of phase 0, I can tell that we will be pushed to our limit at DBC. The work we did for phase 0 so far hasn't been too difficult, but it did require a lot of dedication. At this point, I'm assuming this is just a precursor for what is to come as we progress through the program.
