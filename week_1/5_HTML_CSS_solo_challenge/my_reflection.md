The question that I had most trouble with was concerned with a matter of creativity. I was having trouble coming up with content for the challenge and I couldn't really come up with anything satisfying so I just created a simple "Hello World" webpage. 

The concepts of relative and absolute positioning still is obscure for me so I'll probably need to do more research; and I'm not sure if I completed the caption over the image correctly. Still, I am relatively confident in my HTML/CSS coding. The challenge wasn't too challenging after having completed the previous challenge and having prior experience working with HTML/CSS and building my own personal webpage. 

I enjoy CSS coding because of its aesthetics and its the code that makes webpages a little more interesting, but I find most of what we're currently working on to be a little tedious as it is all a bit basic.
