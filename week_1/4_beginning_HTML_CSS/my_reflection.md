## 4.[Beginning HTML and CSS](4_beginning_HTML_CSS/readme.mc) Reflection

* What makes sense to your about HTML? What doesn't? 
* What seems good and bad about HTML?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

My understanding of HTML is that it is mainly used for the formatting, layout, and positioning of content. Each html tag works like a container for content to be stored between. HTML seems limited to me without CSS. 

I like to use http://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp to develop and reference my HTML coding; and http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/ for CSS coding.
