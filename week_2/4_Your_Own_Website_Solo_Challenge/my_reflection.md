Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience? 
<p>Design and user experience have really become a significant factor in a user's decision to invest his/her time with a company, organization, and website. It is important to design for the user rather than constructing from brand identity. Users know that they can, for the most part, find other sources or products anywhere on the web. What keeps users returning to a specific website or company is how they interface and experience the design of a web page.</p>
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)
<p>I do like design and user experience. I believe it is essential to have an interesting design in order to retain visitors. With more time and development of my skills, I think I would have and will be able to incorporate some ideas that I could not and cannot yet incorporate into my design. In this challenge I came up with several different ideas for the layout of my web page until finally settling on one that I believe to be the most user friendly and somewhat unique.</p>
* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?
<p>One thing that my ideas kept being limited by was the limitations of HTML and CSS. I wanted to incorporate more interactive, dynamic, animate qualities to my design, but I knew that my ideas would require Javascript.</p>
* What would you like to add or change about the site next?
<p>I would like to make my web page more responsive using @media screen. I'd also like to create a better more organic flow; and of course, utilize javascript in order to make my webpage more dynamic.</p>
* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?
<p>With peer pairing, the material was much easier to grasp and apply. I really enjoyed the material on creating responsive web pages.</p>
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
