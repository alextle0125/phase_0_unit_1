# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?
<p>I think that in the state that they currently are, they are a little bit disorganized and inconsistent. I think this is due to the fact that they were pretty much an after-thought where any sort of new or developing standard is basically just appended to the existing structure.</p>
* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?
<p>Standard structure does make sense to me. I think it'll improve the consistency of the web environment to have some sort of unity. It would certainly make parsing sheets of code and analyzing code documents more of an easy task by hand or by software. It would improve the state of accessible web for the visually impaired.</p>
* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?
<p>I don't necessarily like them any better or worse than the common 'div' tag; but then again, conventionality would probably benefit the larger web community.</p>
* Why is reset.css necessary?
<p>reset.css allows for the stripping down of web effects to foundational elements. It's good to be able to see all of the individual parts that make up the HTML.</p> 
* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?
<p>I use Google Chrome and then Mozilla Firefox. I find browser compatibility to be one of the most troublesome parts of web design. I think it's a terrible thing that the display of content varies across browsers.</p>
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
I mainly use the W3Schools' HTML and CSS reference to reinforce my HTML/CSS coding and learning.
