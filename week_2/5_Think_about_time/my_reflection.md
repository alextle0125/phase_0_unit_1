# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? 
<p>The biggest challenge I have with regards to time management is balancing and divvying time for the Phase 0 challenges with my work schedule; and of course, finding time for leisure and social interaction to keep me "well-adjusted."</p>
* How will you combat that?
<p>I liked the Pomodoro Technique. I think to help establish a balance between my time-commitments, I will measure and track my work progress. This should help me assess an estimate of how much time and effort certain challenges will require of me so that I can plan my week accordingly.</p> 
* What techniques will you try?
<p>I really enjoyed all of the articles and found them all to be very enlightening. I hope to be able to apply all of the techniques discussed in each article; but found the pomodoro technique, the minimum viable product (MVP) approach, habit creation, and the BJ Fogg tiny habit method to be techniques that might be really useful.</p>
* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?
<p>My overall plan is to just gauge myself as I work on each Phase 0 challenge. Once I have a better idea of how I work through the challenges, I can better plan my schedule accordingly. This should also allow me time for plotting out a plan of attack on each challenge so that I may produce higher quality work. I also have plans to do Yoga with a friend which should both help to develop my focus and relieve stresses and anxieties, while keeping me socially accomodated.</p>
