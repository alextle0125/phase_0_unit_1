# U1.W2: Chrome Dev Tools Challenge Reflection

* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?
<p>DOM is a way of organizing the different elements of a web page into a tree-like structure. DOM makes it easier for developers to search through and modify the many different parts of a web page.</p>
* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?
<p>My site is pretty minimal with very basic HTML/CSS. The wordpress site incorporates a lot of different interactive, backend features. The wordpress site uses a multitude of javascript scripts.</p>
* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?
<p>I really enjoyed Chrome Web Tools and think that it is a useful and easy-to-use tool for web development.</p>
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
<p>Network optimization was a revelationary surprise to me. I now understand the significance of coding and uploading files with download optimization in mind. Network optimization also helped to reinforce server/network operations.</p>
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
