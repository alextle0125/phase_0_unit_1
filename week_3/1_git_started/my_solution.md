## Release 2: Basic Git Commands
Define the following commands and describe how they work/what they do.  


#### add
<p>'git add' places files and changes that have not been committed to your repo yet; into a staging status where it will be ready to be committed. This is similar to loading a canon ball before actually firing the canon.</p>

#### branch
<p>'git branch' will allow you to create a parallel version of the master repo which you can work on and include your revisions. This is useful when working with collaborators where each individual collaborator can create a branch and make their personal edits.</p>

#### checkout
<p>'git checkout' is used for navigating between repos or branches. It allows you to move and look at the repository or branch that you specify.</p>

#### clone
<p>'git glone' allows you to copy a repository into a new repository.</p>

#### commit
<p>'git commit' takes the files and changes made in the staging area of the current repo and updates the repo with the modifications. 'git commit' takes a "snapshot" of the modifications made - providing version control.</p>

#### fetch
<p>'git fetch' allows you to retrieve modifications made by others on a current repo. It allows you to retrieve all of the remote-traking branches without mergining the changes into your own branches.</p>

#### log
<p>'git log' displays all of the commits that have been made to the repo. It essentially provides a history similar to your browser history.</p>

#### merge
<p>'git merge' allows you to merge all of your changes made on a branch of the repo into the master branch.</p>

#### pull
<p>'git pull' will allow you to access and download the most up-to-date GitHub version of your repo. This function is similar to fetch except that it will automatically merge the GitHub version into your local version of the repo.</p>

#### push
<p>'git push' will submit all the commits made on your local repo onto your GitHub repo. This is essentially the opposite of 'git pull' where with 'git pull' you are downloading and with 'git push' you are uploading.</p>

#### reset
<p>'git reset' will allow you to unstage specified files.</p>

#### rm
<p>'git rm' will remove the specified files from the disk and place the removal action onto the staging area to be committed.</p>

#### status
<p>'git status' will display the status of your repo. It will display the files that your repo contains, the changes that need to be committed, and the current branch of the repo that you're working on.</p>
