// My role in the group is: Person 3 - Translate Pseudocode into Code

// __________________________________________
// Reflection: Use the reflection guidelines to write a reflection here. 
// My strategy here was to trust my group-mates and of course have tons of Javascript references on deck as I ran and 
// checked my code in node.js' interactive mode. I worked through each pseudocode individually with the 
// javascript_intro_lab documentation and w3schools documentation to guide me. I also reviewed prior challenges for 
// guidance with the assertion tasks (as I am not very experienced creating assertions). I ran into some issues with
// syntax, but managed to work through them with the resources I referred to earlier. A specific function that I had
// issues and concerns about was a median finding function - that according to the pseudocode, resulted in a variety 
// of outputs depending upon the structure and items of an array. It didn't quite fit my understanding of the median
// value; but I decided to trust my group, and output a solution that would satisfy the pseudocode tests. This challenge
// definitely tested my knowledge of Javascript and Javascript syntax. I learned a lot of operational techniques and feel
// much more comfortable writing assertions. I feel mild-moderately confident in my abilities after this challenge; as I
// know that I will still need to frequently reference documentation and review past coding. I enjoyed working with more
// complicated material and developing my JS skills. I didn't find any of this tedious. I find that doing this type of
// group development requires every member to be on-point. I definitely felt some pressure - not to let the group down.
// I guess that might be a good thing. I also think this type of team development requires some intuition into what your
// partner(s) are expecting and intuition on what your partner(s) may be missing. My portion of the project involved the
// actual coding. It was heavily logic based but definitely was advantageous in developing my JS knowledge.
